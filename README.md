# 🛠️ Silent Worker App — by Virusia Tech Industries

A stealth-mode background agent designed to execute routine or custom tasks silently and efficiently. No UI, no system tray presence — just pure, behind-the-scenes automation.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The Silent Worker App is a lightweight, invisible desktop application that:
- Runs silently in the background
- Does not appear in the taskbar or system tray
- Starts automatically with system boot
- Executes predefined tasks (e.g., monitoring, file syncing, background logging)
- Can optionally communicate with a remote server or save local logs

---

## ✅ Use Cases

- Developer task monitoring (e.g., Interview Coder behavior)
- Local automation without user interference
- Silent file change trackers or loggers
- Background resource schedulers
- Internal productivity agents

Let me know if you'd like this to be auto-generated based on specific modules you're plugging into the app (e.g., file watcher, remote syncer, etc.), and I can modularize it. Want a `config.json` template too?
